# Verified Software Toolchain with extensions for external reasoning

(as described in _Connecting Higher-Order Separation Logic with a First-Order Outside World_)

Building the repository requires Coq 8.9.0 and the [Interaction Trees](https://github.com/DeepSpec/InteractionTrees) library. The latter can be installed via OPAM by running `opam install coq-itree`. To build all relevant proofs, run `make -j8 progs/verif_io.vo progs/verif_io_mem.vo` (replace the 8 with the number of cores on your computer).

The definitions and theorems of the paper can be found in the following locations:

Section 2:

ghost algebras: msl/ghost.v<br/>
rules for ghost state (Figure 2): msl/ghost_seplog.v<br/>
